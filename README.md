# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide is to discover trends and insights in the ride-sharing data from urban, suburban and rural populations for the CEO of Pyber. Any insights and discoveries will be discussed in the results section and then finally recommendations will be provded based on the analysis. Ride Sharing Data is included from January to March of 2019 and this data is organized based on the before-mentioned "city types". The raw data is also included in the from of csv files included in the 
resources folder (Pyber_Analysis/Resources/). This analysis was completed using Jupyter Notebook, with Matplotlib and Pandas. 
## Results 
As we can see from our compact and accurate graph [analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png](analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png), we have three different lines that are representative of 
significant change based on city type. Urban rides generated the highest amount of fares, followed by suburban and then finally rurals rides. That being said, the most drivers
are also located in urban cities with 2405 drivers, then followed by suburban cities with 490 drivers, and finally rural cities with only 78 drivers.This low amount of rural drivers results in the most fare per ride occuring in rural cities, then suburban, then urban cities, and also the most fare(s) per driver following the same trend.
