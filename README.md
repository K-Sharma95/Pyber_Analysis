# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to process ride-sharing data from urban, suburban and rural populations for the CEO of Pyber (a ride sharing organization). Any insights and trends will be discussed in the results section and then finally recommendations will be provded based on the analysis. Ride Sharing Data is included from January to March of 2019 and this data is organized based on the before-mentioned "city types". The raw data is also included in the from of csv files included in the resources folder (Pyber_Analysis/Resources/). This analysis was completed using Jupyter Notebook, with Matplotlib and Pandas technologies
## Results 
As we can see from our compact and accurate graph [analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png](analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png), we have three different lines that are representative of 
significant change based on city type. Urban rides generated the highest amount of fares, followed by suburban and then finally rurals rides. That being said, the most drivers
are also located in urban cities with 2405 drivers, then followed by suburban cities with 490 drivers, and finally rural cities with only 78 drivers.This low amount of rural drivers, and other factors, results in the most fare per ride occuring in rural cities, then suburban, then urban cities, and also the most fare(s) per driver following the same trend. 

## Summary 
Based on these results I can make three recommendations for Pyber;s management:
1. *Invest in more rural drivers* 

It can be deduced by the high fares per driver and high fares per ride in the rural cities that there is demand for more rides in rural areas. This will allow for more rides to take place and Pyber to effeciently add more revenue.

2. *Reduce Urban Drivers*

In order to solve the problem of less profitable rides happening in urban cities, and increase more profitible rides in suburban/rural cities, Pyber should provide an incentive for the large amount of drivers to relocate or work in less populated cities. This will help Pyber generate revenue by using existing drivers in more lucritive areas.

3. *Adress the Upward trend in the Suburban City type* 

As we can see on the fare summary line graph, the fares after April of 2019 are increasing in Suburban cities. This is likely due to the drivers there experiencing more rides and more drivers joining the workforce as the Suburbs grow larger and more similar to urban cities. To combat this Pyber should consider where demand has increased and tactically position suburban drivers in these places.
